## Introduction

The T07 mini is an outdoor robotics platform intended for participation in contests like Robotem Rovne, Roboorienteering or Robotour but also for general robotic experiments. There is also a mounting option for the [mandeye-controller](https://github.com/JanuszBedkowski/mandeye_controller).

## electronics and software

There are mounting holes for a Raspberry Pi or a [Pika Spark](https://docs.pika-spark.io/) on the controller standoff.

[CyphalRobotController07/CAN](https://github.com/generationmake/CyphalRobotController07-CAN) is the main controller board.
